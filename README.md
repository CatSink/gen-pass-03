# <Random Password Generator>

## Description
This project is a beginner exercise in applying JavaScript to a webpage to add functionality. The appliction of JavaScript within a page offers several options for interaction with the user and collection of data and preferences. This webpage is an isolated user experience targeting password generation. It is meant to assist the user in creating a custom password to increase security. I still have a lot to learn about the various methods and uses for JavaScript and look forward to getting more familiar with how it can be utilitized for optimal user experiences.

## Usage
